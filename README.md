> *"One Size Fits All" Isn't The Most Effective: Why heart disease prediction requires understanding institutional differences*

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Why This Dataset?

I chose the **UCI Heart Disease Database** because I am come from a medical background and have a strong interest in healthcare analytics. Heart disease is a leading cause of death worldwide, and accurate prediction models can save lives through early intervention. This dataset uniquely combines data from **four different medical institutions** (Cleveland Clinic, Hungarian Institute of Cardiology, University Hospital Zurich, and V.A. Medical Center Long Beach). This multi-origin structure makes it perfect for exploring a critical but often overlooked question in medical machine learning:

**Can models trained on one institution's data generalize to other populations?**

Most ML researchers focus only on the Cleveland dataset, which represents just one patient population. By analyzing all four origins together, we can investigate: - How patient characteristics vary across different origins - Whether feature relationships are universal or population-specific - Why "one-size-fits-all" models may fail when applied to new settings

This dataset reveals real-world challenges in medical AI: distribution shifts, missing data patterns, and population variability that must be addressed for fair and accurate prediction.

## What I Learned from IDA/EDA

### Key Insights from Initial Data Analysis

1.  **Significant Prevalence Differences (45.9% Cleveland → 93.5% Switzerland)**
    -   Heart disease rates vary dramatically by origin
    -   Cleveland likely serves higher-risk or specialty populations
    -   Models trained on one origin will systematically over/under-estimate risk elsewhere
    -   This is the **base rate fallacy** in action
2.  **Origin-Specific Missing Data Patterns**
    -   Hungary & Long Beach VA: `ca` (coronary vessels) = 0 for ALL patients
    -   Switzerland: `chol` (cholesterol) = 0 for ALL patients
    -   These aren't true zeros. They most likely represent different data collection procedures/equipment
    -   Imputation must respect these institutional differences to avoid bias
3.  **Feature Distributions Vary Significantly**
    -   Blood pressure, cholesterol, and heart rate distributions differ across origins
    -   Example: `trestbps`-`age` correlation is 2x stronger in Switzerland (0.37) vs Long Beach (0.18)
    -   Different patient populations, fitness levels, or testing protocols
4.  **Relationship Patterns Are Not Universal**
    -   Age-heart rate decline varies by origin (different slopes in LOESS curves)
    -   `oldpeak` (ST depression) predicts heart disease 2x better in Cleveland (0.42) than Long Beach (0.21)
    -   Feature importance is population-dependent
5.  **Categorical Distributions Reveal Referral Bias**
    -   Different chest pain type distributions suggest varying patient pathways
    -   Some institutions may see more severe cases (specialty clinic effect)
    -   Impacts how we should interpret and model the data

### Evidence Against "One-Size-Fits-All" Models

Every analysis page reveals origin-specific patterns: - **Distributions**: Different medians and shapes across origins - **Relationships**: Varying correlation structures in heatmaps - **Categories**: Different symptom/test result distributions - **Prevalence**: Differences in heart disease rates

**Conclusion**: Models must account for these institutional differences to avoid biased predictions and ensure fairness in healthcare AI.

## Preprocessing Steps Completed

### 1. Data Loading & Combination

-   Loaded four datasets from UCI repository (Cleveland, Hungary, Switzerland, Long Beach VA)
-   Added `origin` identifier to track institutional source
-   Removed duplicate rows (minimal: \~2 rows total)
-   Combined into single multi-origin dataset

### 2. Target Variable Creation

-   Created binary `target` variable from original `num` (diagnosis)
-   `target = 1` when `num > 0` (any heart disease present)
-   `target = 0` when `num = 0` (no disease)
-   Simplifies multi-class problem to binary classification

### 3. Missing Data Handling

-   Converted `?` symbols to `NaN` for proper missing value representation
-   Identified origin-specific missing patterns (`ca`, `chol`)
-   Preserved zeros for ca and chol columns to maintain data authenticity and reveal institutional differences
-   Missing data rates vary by origin (evidence of different protocols)
-   Hidden missing values (e.g., all zeros) identified and treated accordingly

### 4. Imputation Strategy

-   **Method**: KNN Imputation (k=5) applied **independently per origin**
-   **Why KNN?**: Preserves local structure and feature relationships better than mean/mode
-   **Why per-origin?**: Prevents data leakage and respects institutional boundaries
-   **Categorical features**: Mode imputation for truly missing values
-   **Result**: Complete dataset while maintaining origin-specific characteristics

### 5. Feature Engineering & Encoding

-   Created human-readable labels alongside numeric codes:
    -   `cp_label`: Chest pain type (typical angina, atypical angina, etc.)
    -   `restecg_label`: Resting ECG results
    -   `slope_label`: ST segment slope
    -   `thal_label`: Thalassemia status
    -   `num_label`: Original diagnosis severity
-   Maintains both formats: numeric for modeling, labels for interpretation
-   Ensured categorical codes stay within valid ranges post-imputation

### 6. Data Validation

-   Verified biological plausibility of values
-   Confirmed no remaining missing values after imputation
-   Checked distributions match expected medical ranges
-   Validated origin-specific patterns are preserved

2. **Global Decision Tree** - Non-linear model (max_depth=5) trained on all origins
3. **Stratified Logistic Regression** - Separate LR models trained per institution
4. **Stratified Decision Tree** - Separate DT models trained per institution

### Evaluation Metrics

- **Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score** - Standard classification metrics
- **ROC-AUC** - Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve
- **Per-Origin Performance Breakdown** - Tests generalization across institutions
- **Confusion Matrices** - Visual comparison of prediction errors
